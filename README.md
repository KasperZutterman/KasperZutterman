### Hi! My name is Kasper Zutterman, thanks for stopping by ðŸ‘‹
I'm a senior at [Ghent University](https://www.ugent.be/en) based in Belgium. I am currently pursuing the Information Engineering Technology master's degree at the Faculty of Engineering.

Last summer, I've worked a summer job at the [KNowledge on Web Scale (KNoWS)](https://knows.idlab.ugent.be/index.html) team to help build the [Basic LDES Server](https://github.com/TREEcg/Basic-LDES-Server) and the [LDES Action](https://github.com/TREEcg/LDES-Action). I got the chance to work on Linked Data problems learning about RDF, Linked Data Event Streams (LDES), Github Actions and so much more!

I'm currently working on my master's thesis, researching a set of best practices for [Linked Data Event Streams (LDES)](https://semiceu.github.io/LinkedDataEventStreams/) for publication, replication and synchronization. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kasperzutterman/) or via [e-mail](mailto:kasperzutterman1999@gmail.com).
